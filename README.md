# TeleStickerSync

Update your Telegram sticker pack from a folder of .tgs files.

Creating and updating Telegram stickers have to be done through the [@Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers) bot, which can be a manual process.
This is especially tedious if you would like to update and upload to see how the stickers turn out on Telegram (somewhat a Edit-Compile-Run cycle but for creating stickers)


## Dependencies
